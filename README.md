# Turing Royale
 
Turing is very hard to work with...

Probably way too ambitious for Turing, I was also attempting to implement a very basic neural network sort of AI, but of course that never came to fruition.

Pretty proud of my implementation of a quadtree and collision response, though. In Turing, no less.
